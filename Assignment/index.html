    <ol><li><b>What are the benefits of using CSS? </b></li>
    <p>With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out,
     what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>

     <li><b>What are the disadvantages of CSS?</b></li>
     <ul>
        <li>CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.</li>
        <li>With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
        <li>There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
        <li>After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.</li>
        <li>The programing language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>
        <li>Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>
        <li>CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.</li>
        <li>There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.</li>
        <li>There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.</li> 
    </ul>

     <li><b>Name a few CSS style components </b></li>
     <p>The components of css style are:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Selecter:HTML element name, id name, class name.</li>
        <li>Property:It's like an attribute such as background color,font-size,position,text-align,color,border etc.</li>
        <li>Values:which defines property or values allocate for properties.</li>
     </ul>
    
     <li><b>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</b></li>
     <p>The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.</p>
    
    <li><b>How can the background color of an element be changed?</b></li>
    <p>The background-color property sets the background color of an element. The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin). Tip: Use a background color and a text color that makes the text easy to read.</p>
    
    <li><b>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</b></li>
    <p>To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property. You can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.</p>
 
    <li><b>What is the use of the background-position property?</b></li>
    <p>The background-position property in CSS is mainly used to sets the initial position for the background image ie., it is used to set an image at a certain position. The position that is relative to the positioning layer, can be set by using the background-origin property.</p>
 
    <li><b>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</b></li>
    <p>The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.</p>

    <li><b>How to center block elements using CSS1? </b></li>
    <p>The way to do that is to set the margins to 'auto'. This is normally used with a block of fixed width, because if the block itself is flexible, it will simply take up all the available width. Here is an example: P.blocktext { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 8em }</p>

    <li><b>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</b></li>
    <ul>
       CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
       <li> Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements. </li>
       <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section. </li>
       <li> External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><b>What is embedded style sheets? </b></li>
    <p>Embedded style sheets allow you to define styles for the whole HTML document in one place. Embedded style sheets refer to when you embed style sheet information into an HTML document using the &lt;style&gt; element. You do this by embedding the style sheet information within &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags in the head of your document.</p>

   <li><b>What are the external style sheets? </b></li>
   <p>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</p>

   <li><b>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</b></li>
   <p>The advantages of External Style Sheets are as follows :</p>
   <ul>
     <li>With the help of External Style Sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single file</li> 
     <li>In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site.</li>
     <li>In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are as follows :</p>
   <ul>
    <li>An extra download is essential to import style information for each file.</li>
    <li>The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.</li>
    <li>While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check compatibility issues.</li>
   </ul>

   <li><b>What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</b></li>
   <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p>

   <li><b>What is the rule set? </b></li>
   <p>A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and one or more declarations. The selector(s), which in this example is h1 , points to an HTML element. The declaration(s), which in this example are color: blue and text-align: center style the element with a property and value.</p>

   <li><b>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</b></li>
   <p>Background and color are seprate properties in CSS because they serve different purposes.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The background property is used to set the background of an element, and it can include multiple values such as background color, background image, background position, background repeat, etc. For example, you might set a solid color background with </li>
    <li>The color property, on the other hand, is used to set the color of text or other content within an elements. For example,  you might set the color of the text to black with:</li>
    <li>In summary, separating background and color into separate properties in CSS provides greater flexibility and control in designing web page.  </li>
   </ul>

   <li><b>How to maintain the CSS specifications? </b></li>
   <p>There are several best practices that can help you maintain the specifications of your CSS code:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Use a CSS preprocessr: A CSS preprocesser such  as sass or less can help you organize your CSS code and make it easier to maintain. You can use variables, mixins, and functions to write DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) code and make updates faster and more efficient.</li>
    <li>Use CSS Framework: A CSS Framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation can provide you with a set of pre-designed UI components and layout options. This can help you build a consistent and rsponsive design faster and with less custom code.</li>
    <li>Use a version control system: A version control system such as Git can help uou track changes to your code and collaborate with others. You can use branches to experiment with new features  and easily revert changes if necessary.</li>
    <li>Test your code: Regularly test your code in different browsers and devices to ensure that if works as expected and is free of bugs. Use browser dev tools to debug and fix  any issues</li>
   </ul>
   <li><b>What are the media types allowed by CSS? </b></li>
   <p>The media allowed by CSS are</p>
   <ul>
    <li>continuous or paged.</li>
    <li>visual, audio, speech, or tactile.</li>
    <li>grid (for character grid devices), or bitmap.</li>
    <li>interactive (for devices that allow user interaction), or static (for those that do not).</li>
    <li>all (includes all media types)</li>
   </ul>
   <div class="layout">
   <li><b>Create Layouts</b> </li>
   <h2>CSS Layout Float</h2>
<p>In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a footer. On smaller screens, the columns will stack on top of each other.</p>

<header class="header">
